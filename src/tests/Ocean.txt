Ocean Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ocean man, take me by the hand, lead me to the land
That you understand
Ocean man, the voyage to the corner of the globe
Is a real trip

[Chorus 1]
Ocean man, the crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land

[Verse 2]
Ocean man, can you see through the wonder of amazement
At the Oberman?
Ocean man, the crust is elusive when it casts forth
To the childlike man
[Chorus 2]
Ocean man, the sequence of a life form braised in the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land
[Guitar Solo]
Ocean man
Ocean man
Ocean man

[Verse 1]
Ocean man, take me by the hand, lead me to the land
That you understand
Ocean man, the voyage to the corner of the globe
Is a real trip (Trip, trip, trip, trip, trip)

[Chorus 1]
Ocean man, the crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land

[Verse 2]
Ocean man, can you see through the wonder of amazement
At the Oberman?
Ocean man, the crust is elusive when it casts forth
To the childlike man

[Chorus 2]
Ocean man, the sequence of a life form braised in the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land
