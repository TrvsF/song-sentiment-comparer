Straight Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
One time that lasts forever
One time that's deep inside
I wanna shake all over again

One time is better than no times
I can't lose for doing a favor
Wanna shake all over again

[Chorus 1]
You go straight down
What's the matter? Don't you trust me?
I only want it on the way down, in a bad way
Is the backseat all mine?
[Verse 2]
I want to live but not be found
I want this one and that one too
I wanna shake all over again

One time is better than no times
I can't lose for doing the favor
Wanna shake all over again

[Chorus 1]
You go straight down
What's the matter? Don't you trust me?
I only want it on the way down, in a bad way
Is the backseat all mine?

[Chorus 2]
Way down, see a lady with a poodle
It's the color of a tomato, in a bad way
Is the backseat all mine?

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus 1]
You go straight down
What's the matter? Don't you trust me?
I only want it on the way down, in a bad way
Is the backseat all mine?
You might also like[Chorus 2]
Way down, see a lady with a poodle
It's the color of tomato, in a bad way
Is the backseat all mine?Embed
